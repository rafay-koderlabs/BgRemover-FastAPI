RMBG v1.4 is our state-of-the-art background removal model, designed to effectively separate foreground from background in a range of
categories and image types. This model has been trained on a carefully selected dataset, which includes:
general stock images, e-commerce, gaming, and advertising content, making it suitable for commercial use cases powering enterprise content creation at scale. 
The accuracy, efficiency, and versatility currently rival leading open source models. 
It is ideal where content safety, legally licensed datasets, and bias mitigation are paramount. 

Developed by BRIA AI, RMBG v1.4 is available as an open-source model for non-commercial use.

## Training data
Bria-RMBG model was trained with over 12,000 high-quality, high-resolution, manually labeled (pixel-wise accuracy), fully licensed images.
Our benchmark included balanced gender, balanced ethnicity, and people with different types of disabilities.
For clarity, we provide our data distribution according to different categories, demonstrating our model’s versatility.

| Objects only | 45.11% |
| People with objects/animals | 25.24% |
| People only | 17.35% |
| people/objects/animals with text | 8.52% |
| Text only | 2.52% |
| Animals only | 1.89% |

| Category | Distribution |
| -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------------:|
| Photorealistic | 87.70% |
| Non-Photorealistic | 12.30% |


| Category | Distribution |
| -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------:|
| Non Solid Background | 52.05% |
| Solid Background | 47.95% 


| Category | Distribution |
